# FormalRV.LatticeSurgery

L3 of the FormalRV stack: lattice-surgery (merge/split) modelling for fault-tolerant Shor's algorithm and the PPM / system-call schedule contracts it must satisfy. A surgery gadget realises one logical Pauli-product measurement (PPM) on a qLDPC code by merging a data code with an ancilla system for `tau_s` cycles, then detaching. These files encode the merged-code parity matrices, a decidable structural verifier, a compiler from gadget descriptions to `SysCall` streams, and the reusable schedule certificate that propagates resource/invariant guarantees upward. Targets qianxu (Cain–Xu et al. 2026) App. C. No Mathlib; pure Bool/Nat/List, fully decidable.

## Layout
- `LDPCSurgery.lean` — the `SurgeryGadget` IR (single data + ancilla block), merged parity matrices, and the headline structural verifier.
- `LatticeSurgeryPPMContract.lean` — the reusable `PPMScheduleCert` contract, system invariants I1–I4, schedule combinators, and composition theorems (largest file, §1–§23).
- `SurgeryGadgetToSysCalls.lean` — compiler from surgery/topology gadgets to `SysCall` streams, plus the combined qLDPC + system-invariant contract theorems.

## Key definitions
- `SurgeryGadget` (`LDPCSurgery.lean`) — single-block surgery gadget: data code, ancilla checks, connection matrices `conn_x`/`conn_z`, `tau_s`, target Pauli, span witness.
- `merged_hx` / `merged_hz` (`LDPCSurgery.lean`) — the merged X/Z parity matrices `[[H_X 0],[f_X' H_X']]`, `[[H_Z f_Z],[0 H_Z']]`.
- `verify_surgery_gadget` (`LDPCSurgery.lean`) — decidable verifier: dimension consistency, qLDPC bound, `tau_s` sufficiency, row-span (kernel) identity.
- `PPMScheduleCert` / `…WithFactoryPorts` (`LatticeSurgeryPPMContract.lean`) — certificate bundling an architecture + `SysCall` stream + proofs of I1–I4 and decoder reaction.
- `seqSchedules` / `parSchedules` / `validateScheduleWithFactoryPorts` (`LatticeSurgeryPPMContract.lean`) — pure schedule combinators and the generic decidable bundle validator.
- `compileTopologySurgeryToSysCalls` (`SurgeryGadgetToSysCalls.lean`) — compiler emitting per-round edge gates / ancilla measures from a gadget's connection topology.
- `verify_surgery_gadget_with_schedule` (`SurgeryGadgetToSysCalls.lean`) — combined checker: structural qLDPC verifier AND strengthened system bundle.

## Key theorems
- `compile_basic_ppm_eq_existing_ppm_block` (`SurgeryGadgetToSysCalls.lean`) — the compiled stream is structurally equal to the hand-written GE2021 PPM block — **Verified** (structural equality, by decide).
- `verify_surgery_gadget_with_schedule_cert_exists` (`SurgeryGadgetToSysCalls.lean`) — a passing combined checker yields a strengthened cert with stream-derived wallclock — **Verified** (reuses the 7-fold invariant unpacking).
- `topology_pair_alias_rejected` (`SurgeryGadgetToSysCalls.lean`) — parallel gadgets sharing ancilla sites are rejected by the bundle — **Verified** (negative case, native_decide).
- `all_invariants_ok_of_cert` (`LatticeSurgeryPPMContract.lean`) — every cert satisfies the framework's bundled I1–I3 invariants — **Verified**.
- `seqSchedules_wallclock_is_derived` / `parSchedules_wallclock_is_derived` (`LatticeSurgeryPPMContract.lean`) — composed-schedule wallclock equals the foldl over its stream (anti-spreadsheet) — **Arithmetic-only** (Nat/rfl identity).
- §22 documented principle (`LatticeSurgeryPPMContract.lean`) — two valid certs do NOT auto-compose; merged streams must be re-validated, with `validate_parallel_alias_false` as the counterexample — **Verified**.

## Status
All proofs discharge by `decide`/`native_decide`/`rfl` with no `sorry` and no custom `axiom`; the system-invariant and structural-correctness claims (dimensions, qLDPC bound, `tau_s`, row-span identity, schedule resources) are genuinely **Verified** at that layer. However, these are structural/resource checks only: quantum-semantic correctness (that the surgery actually measures the claimed Pauli product), decoder correctness, per-SysCall duration physics, and RSA-2048-scale schedules are explicitly out of scope and remain unverified. Merged-code distance `d̃ = Θ(d_data)` is accepted as an implementer-supplied, paper-cited input (**Axiom**-equivalent, not proven here).

## Worked example — measuring logical X̄ on the [[13,1,3]] surface code

![surface-code surgery syndrome extraction](../../docs/diagrams/surface3_syndrome.png)

`surface3_x_surgery` merges one ancilla into the distance-3 surface code to measure
the logical `X̄ = X₆X₇X₈`. `StimEmit.surgeryToStim` emits the merged-code syndrome
circuit (above: each X-check is an ancilla in `|+⟩`, `CX anc→support`, `MX`; each
Z-check is `CX support→anc`, `M`). `surface3_x_surgery_measures_logicalX`
(`Corpus/SurgeryDemoSurface.lean:118`, **Verified**, axiom-clean) proves the
span-witness-selected ancilla X-checks multiply to exactly `signedXRow X̄`, and
`surface3_x_surgery_verifies` passes the structural verifier. Stim's `has_flow` then
re-derives the same fact externally — the LaSsynth gold standard.

### More small examples

2. **The row-span check, concretely.** For `surface3_x_surgery` the span witness
   `[F,F,F,F,F,F,T,T]` selects the two ancilla X-checks; `row_combination witness
   merged_hx = target_pauli` evaluates to the `X̄ = X₆X₇X₈` row
   (`targets_logical_correctly`, by `decide`) — the GF(2) fact that
   `selectedSignedProduct_eq` lifts to the signed Pauli product.
3. **Rejecting a bad gadget.** `topology_pair_alias_rejected`
   (`SurgeryGadgetToSysCalls.lean:834`, `native_decide`) proves the combined checker
   returns `false` for two parallel gadgets that *share* ancilla sites — a structural
   aliasing bug caught before any physics (the contract file's §22 shows two
   individually-valid certs that must NOT auto-compose).

## Essential proof techniques

- **Logical measurement as a row-span identity.** Correctness is the statement that
  the target logical operator lies in the GF(2) row span of the merged X-checks. The
  proof links three layers in lockstep: a GF(2)→Pauli homomorphism
  (`xRow_vec_xor_ops`: vector XOR = Pauli product on X-supports, always trivial
  phase), `selectedSignedProduct_eq` (signed product of selected checks = the
  lowering of `row_combination`), and the decidable kernel check
  `row_combination span_witness merged_hx = target_pauli` (`targets_logical_correctly`).
- **Non-disturbance by Gottesman bookkeeping.** `surgery_preserves_commuting_logical`
  shows any logical commuting with all merged X-checks survives the merge, by
  threading the single-measurement step (`apply_PPM_pos_preserves_mem_of_commutes`)
  through the check list by induction.
- **Everything decidable.** Dimension consistency, the qLDPC weight bound,
  `3·τ_s ≥ 2d`, and the kernel condition are all `decide`/`native_decide` `Bool`
  checks — no `sorry`, no custom axiom.

Honest scope: these are structural / stabilizer-level guarantees; merged-code
distance `d̃ = Θ(d)`, decoder correctness, and per-SysCall physics are explicitly
out of scope (implementer-supplied, paper-cited).
