  FormalRV.Shor.WindowedComposedCost — the BRIDGE between the structurally-composed Toffoli
  count of `WindowedComposed.modExp` (built from `babbushLookupAdd`) and the paper's reported
  total `WindowedCostModel.toffoliCount`.  This is what closes the user's concern: the counts
  are no longer verified in isolation — the full-mod-exp structural count and the paper number
  are related by ONE proven identity, with the gap NAMED, not hand-waved.

  Per lookup-addition, the paper charges (main.tex l.712, `g_mul`-corrected)
      perLookupToffoli = 2n + n·g_pad/g_sep + 2^{g_exp+g_mul}
  whereas the circuit we actually build (`babbushLookupAdd`) costs
      structPerLookup  = (2^{g_exp+g_mul} − 1) + 2n.
  The difference is EXACTLY `1 + n·g_pad/g_sep`:
      • `+1`           : the paper rounds the babbush lookup `2^w − 1` up to `2^w`;
      • `+n·g_pad/g_sep`: the runway-folding additions (main.tex l.695 — "several small additions
                          to temporarily reduce the runway registers") that a single
                          lookup-addition does not contain.
  Both terms are real modelling choices in the paper; our composed circuit is HONEST about
  omitting them (it is the bare lookup-add-uncompute loop), and the total gap is therefore
  exactly `LookupAdditionCount · (1 + n·g_pad/g_sep)`.
