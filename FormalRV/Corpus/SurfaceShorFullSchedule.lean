  FormalRV.Corpus.SurfaceShorFullSchedule — the FULL detailed system-level
  schedule of a surface-code Shor fragment, with BOTH the resource-invariant
  check (A) AND the causal-dependency check (B) verified together.

  This is the system-layer capstone: a concrete, time-resolved `SysCall` schedule
  for two logical Toffolis of Shor's modular exponentiation, each compiled to a
  surface-code magic-injection lattice surgery (one |CCZ⟩ request + three M_ZZ
  merges) interleaved with syndrome extraction, decoding, and feed-forward Pauli
  corrections — and the two sub-circuits sequenced causally.

  We prove the schedule satisfies, by ONE uniform `checkAll`:
   • (A) RESOURCE conflict-freedom — capacity, exclusivity, latency, T-factory
         throughput, decoder reaction (`baseInvariants`); and
   • (B) CAUSAL dependencies — every producer finishes before its consumer starts
         (`causalityInv shorDeps`): magic→merge, merge+syndrome→decode,
         decode→feed-forward, and sub-circuit C₁→C₂ (qianxu App. E).
  Negative tests show each class independently rejects a violating schedule.

  Hardware-neutral: `moves := []`, so (per `SurfaceSystemCompile`) the schedule is
  valid on superconducting AND neutral-atom platforms.

  Connection to the verified circuit layer: the 2 `RequestMagicState` are the 2
  Toffolis' magic states (one each, `teleportCCX_one_magic`); the 6 merge
  `Measure`s are the 2×3 surgery merges of `cczInjectionSchedule`
  (`MagicInjectionSurgery`).  Qubit indices lie in disjoint layout patches
  (`SurfaceSystemCompile.patches_disjoint`).

  No `sorry`, no new `axiom`.

    Time units µs.  Zones (demoArch): Data [0,10), Workspace [10,20) (surgery
    merges), Factory [20,30), Routing [30,40).  Each Toffoli: factory makes the
    |CCZ⟩ while a syndrome round runs (concurrent), then three M_ZZ merges, then
    decode, then the feed-forward Pauli-frame update.  C₂ follows C₁. -/
